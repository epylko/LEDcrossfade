# LEDcrossfade
Crossfade demo of LED pixels

I was having a hard time finding a python LED library that would do a crossfade between colors on an LED strip.

One that I saw would turn gradually turn off the LEDs and turn them back on with the new colors.

This crossfades the RGB values while the strip is on.
